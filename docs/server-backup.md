# Backups

We know that no one (organization) can guarantee that the EC2 will always be up and running. If EC2 fails to start or fails to connect, what would happen without backups? Is it worthwhile to try?

If there is a backup, it can be restored, which greatly reduce the loss.

For AWS, to create backup for EC2 is based on automatic snapshot for the volume of EC2.

There are two entries to create backups on AWS console:

## Snapshot Backup

### Automatic Backup

1. Login to AWS console.  

2. Open【EC2】>【ELASTIC BLOCK STORE】>【Lifecycle Manager】>【Create Snapshot Lifecycle Policy】.
